# About DeviceConnect WebAPI
"DeviceConnect WebAPI" is WebAPI which operates as a virtual server on a smart phone. It can use easily various wearable devices and an IoT device by unific description from a web browser or an application.

# Introduction
Device Connect system is a multi-OS, on the run-time environment of multi-platform, provides API (RESTful) for connection to a smart device.<br>
Thus, it is intended to improve the convenience of the connection and cooperation method between the smart device.<br>
<br> Function list Device Connect system provides is as follows.

- Service discovery
- Connection I/F eliminate (Bluetooth, BLE, Wi-Fi, NFC) a descriptive difficulty of the difference of
- Uniform API provided by equipment profiles
- Application authorization by users

# Security

Device Connect system implements the security features that are defined on the OMA GotAPI v1.0.

## Application approval feature

It is the feature to block accesses from applications which are not authorized by user.

When a Device Connect application accesses the Device Connect system at first, the application should get an access token with authorization. If an application tries to access the device without access token, the Device Connect system will return an error to the application.

In addition, this feature can be turned OFF in the setting window of the Device Connect Manager.

## Server spoofing detection

NOTE: This feature is currently supported by only Android version.

It is the feature to detect by applications whether Device Connect system is the spoofed by other applications or not.

The following is a summary of the sequence of this feature.

First, an application will ask the Device Connect system to sign the response message. The request should be sent in the URL scheme. In addition, the request contains the string which is a key of the signature of response messages.

If a response messages does not have a valid signature subsequently, the application which has received the response message should determine that the response message is not be sent by the valid Device Connect system.

Please refer the specifications of the OMA GotAPI v1.0 for a detailed sequence.

## Access restrictions

It is the feature to prohibit accesses from applications which are not included in the white list.

If this feature is turned ON, the Device Connect system checks the Origin header of the request message received from the application. If 'Origin' is not included in the white list, the Device Connect system will return an error to the application.

Users can configure the Device Connect Manager to allow accesses from specific origins in the setting window of the Device Connect Manager.

In addition, this feature can be turned OFF in the setting window of the Device Connect Manager.

# Application Requirements
## Application must specify the origin of requests
According to OMA GotAPI 1.0, the access from an Device Connect application will be authorized by the Device Connect system if the application has sent a HTTP request.
That is why the Device Connect system returns an error response for the request which does not specify its origin.
A Device Connect application should specify the origin of a HTTP request when the application sends the HTTP request.

### For HTML Applications
HTML application must specify `Origin` header defined by [RFC6454](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6454.txt) in HTTP request header.

Example:

```
GET /gotapi/availability HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:4035
Origin: http://xxx.example.com/
```

The `Origin` header is specified automatically by Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers, except for cases that GET request is sent from the address bar.

### For OS-native Applications
OS-native application must specify the identifier of the application (its package name) in `X-GotAPI-Origin` header.

Example:

```
GET /gotapi/availability HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:4035
X-GotAPI-Origin: com.example.android.app
```

# Repository of DeviceConnect

* [DeviceConnect-Android](http://github/DeviceConnect-Android)<br>
It is a repository that sample implement DeviceConnect platform on Android.<br>
In Android terminal, if you want to operate the DeviceConnect, please check out from this repository.<br>
<br>
* [DeviceConnect-iOS](http://github/DeviceConnect-iOS)<br>
It is a repository that sample implement DeviceConnect platform on iOS.<br>
In iOS terminal, if you want to operate the DeviceConnect, please check out from this repository.<br>
<br>
* [DeviceConnect-JS](http://github/DeviceConnect-JS)<br>
It is a repository that implements the SDK for calling DeviceConnect from HTML.

# Example for Android
* https://github.com/DeviceConnect/DeviceConnect-Docs/blob/master/Bin/demoWebSite.zip

_Updated some package names of the sample for Android at 2014/10/15._
_Please reinstall by following procedure if you would check this sample again._

```
  1. Delete files that are related to the demoWebSite.zip on internal storage.
  2. Uninstall a APK of old Manager and plugins.
  3. Choose "CLEAR BROWSING DATA..." in "history" on Chrome Browser menu.
  4. Choose "Clear" button with "Clear the cache" check box.
  5. Refer to the procedure for "Example for Android" in "Readme.md".
```

1.Make this Folder to Android's internal Storage.
```
Android root
   └── mnt
       └── sdcard
           └── demoWebSite
```

2.Access the internal file URI with Firefox browser.
```
  [例] file:///sdcard/demoWebSite/index.html
```

3.Install the Manager APK and the Android Host APK from "Download APK".
  If you have other supported gadgets , install other APKs.

4.Go back to the top page.

5.Try the prototype GotAPI behavior from "Launch UI-App".

##About access from the external devices

By adding the parameter of the IP address to the demoWebSite URL, can control the external device  by DeviceConnect WebAPI  at a local network. However, the following settings are required for terminal on the operation side.

_*Please do not use at network that can not be trusted because there is a security risk._

1. By the procedure as above , set up the DeviceConnect WebAPI to the terminal of the operation target.

2. Start the DeviceConnectManager from the launcher of Android,and turn off the slide toggle for DeviceConnectManager  service.
3. Enable "Allow External IP" checkbox, and turn on the slide toggle for DeviceConnectManager  service.

4. Add the IP address of the operation target in URL of demoWebSite on the operation side terminal.
```
 e.g. file:///C:/demoWebSite/demo/index.html?ip=192.168.13.3#demo
 ```
